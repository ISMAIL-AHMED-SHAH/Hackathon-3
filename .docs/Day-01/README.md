# DAY 1: LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR MY MARKETPLACE JOURNEY  

Today marked the beginning of the Marketplace Builder Hackathon. We were provided with a detailed document outlining key concepts related to General E-Commerce, Q-Commerce, and Rental E-Commerce. This included an introduction to essential business jargon, guidance on defining marketplace types, and writing down our business goals and ideas.  

The primary task for the day was **brainstorming** to generate unique ideas and creating a **data schema** on **paper** to identify core business entities.  

By engaging in brainstorming, numerous ideas came to mind, but I decided to focus on the provided template, whose UI/UX we had already created in the previous hackathon. This template is centered around a furniture marketplace, which I plan to expand after completing this hackathon by adding schemas for rental products as well, such as chairs and tables, commonly rented for occasions and parties.

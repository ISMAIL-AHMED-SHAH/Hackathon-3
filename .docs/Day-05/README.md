# Day 5 - Testing, Error Handling, and Backend Integration Refinement

## 🛠️ Functional Testing
I have implemented comprehensive functional testing to validate all marketplace features. The following aspects were tested:
- ✅ **Product listing:** Ensured correct display of products.
- ✅ **Filters and search:** Verified accurate results based on user inputs.
- ✅ **Cart operations:** Tested adding, updating, and removing items.
- ✅ **Dynamic routing:** Checked proper navigation to product detail pages.


## ⚠️ Error Handling
Implemented robust error handling with clear fallback messages. Key implementations:
- ✅ **Handled network failures** gracefully.
- ✅ **Displayed user-friendly messages** for invalid or missing data.
- ✅ **Used try-catch blocks** to manage API failures.
- ✅ **Fallback UI elements:** Displayed alternative content when data is unavailable.

```javascript
  try {
    return client.fetch(relatedProductsQuery, { category, slug });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching related products:", error);
    return [];
  }
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimization
I optimized the marketplace for speed and responsiveness using:
- ✅ **Lighthouse & GTmetrix** to identify bottlenecks.
- ✅ **Image compression** using TinyPNG.
- ✅ **Lazy loading for large assets**.
- ✅ **Browser caching & minimized CSS/JS** for faster load times.

## 🌐 Cross-Browser & Device Testing
I ensured compatibility across multiple devices and browsers:
- ✅ **Tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.**
- ✅ **Responsive design validated using BrowserStack.**
- ✅ **Manual testing on a physical mobile device.**

   ### Tested on Different Browsers

## 🔒 Security Testing
I conducted security checks to ensure safe user interactions:
- ✅ **Sanitized input fields** to prevent SQL Injection & XSS attacks.
- ✅ **Used HTTPS for secure API calls.**
- ✅ **Stored API keys in environment variables.**
- ✅ **Validated user inputs using regex patterns.**



## 👥 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
Simulated real-world user scenarios to validate:
- ✅ **Browsing, searching, and checkout flows.**
- ✅ **User-friendly navigation and interactions.**
- ✅ **Gathered feedback and applied necessary fixes.**
